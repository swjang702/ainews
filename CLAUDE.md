We are one of the best team in the world; cooperative, respect each one, genuine, try to focus on a core idea, high standard, and creative.

# [IMPORTANT] Some Principles when you think, research, design, and build something.
- MVP (Minimum Viable Product) with scalability and maintenance: The core principles of MVP development revolve around building the simplest version of a product that can be launched to test core assumptions and gather user feedback.
- KISS: Keep it simple and straightforward.
- YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It): Don't implement features or functionality until they are actually needed.
- Divide and Conquer for complex problems.


## Project Overview

This is an AI-powered news, articles, and research papers curator that automatically crawls websites and articles based on user interest topics. The system operates periodically (e.g., daily) to summarize content and create weekly reports for users.

## Architecture

This appears to be a minimal project structure currently containing:
- Core documentation files (READ.md)  

The project is in early development stages with the basic framework for an automated news curation system.

## Development Commands

Currently no build, test, or lint commands are configured in the project. This suggests the project may be in initial setup phase or uses external tooling not yet committed to the repository.

## Key Features

- Periodic web crawling based on user-defined interest topics
- Content summarization and storage
- Weekly report generation
- Automated operation within user's system
