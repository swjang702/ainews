# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI-powered news, articles, and research papers curator that automatically crawls websites and articles based on user interest topics. The system operates periodically (e.g., daily) to summarize content and create weekly reports for users.

## Architecture

This appears to be a minimal project structure currently containing:
- Core documentation files (READ.md)  

The project is in early development stages with the basic framework for an automated news curation system.

## Development Commands

Currently no build, test, or lint commands are configured in the project. This suggests the project may be in initial setup phase or uses external tooling not yet committed to the repository.

## Key Features

- Periodic web crawling based on user-defined interest topics
- Content summarization and storage
- Weekly report generation
- Automated operation within user's system
